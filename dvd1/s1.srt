I have looked everywhere,

55
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,812
Sister Bernice,
considering that it's Maria...

56
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:54,110
I suggestyou look
in someplace unusual.

57
00:09:58,365 --> 00:09:59,560
Well, Reverend Mother...

58
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,067

00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:10,576
I always tryto keepfaith

Ofall thecandidates
forthe novitiate...

66
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:22,849
I would say Maria is
the least likely--

67
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,721
Children, children!

Tell me, SisterCatherine,

00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:36,830
Itwas the mountain
that led metoyou.

168
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,166
Oh?

169
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:40,195
When I was a child,
I would comedown the mountain...

170
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:42,674
and climba treeand look
overintoyourgarden.

171
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,460
I'd seethesisters atwork...

172
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:47,468
and I'd hearthem sing
on theirwaytovespers...

173
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:50,471
which brings metoanother
transgression, Reverend Mother.

174
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:53,952
I was singing outtheretoday
without permission.

175
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:56,148
Maria, it is onlyhere
in theabbey...

176
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:58,623
thatwe have rules about
postulants singing.

177
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:00,318
I can'tseem tostop
singingwhereverl am.

178
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:03,351
Andwhat'sworse, I can't
seem tostopsaying things--

179
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:05,182
Everything and anything
I thinkand feel.

180
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,620
Some peoplewould
call that honesty.

181
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,327
But it's terrible,
Reverend Mother.

182
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:12,497
You know howSister Berthe
always makes me kiss thefloor...

183
00:16:12,606 --> 00:16:14,495
afterwe'vehadadisagreement?

184
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:18,192
Latelyl'vetaken to kissing
thefloorwhen I see hercoming...

185
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:19,962
justtosavetime.

186
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,482
Maria,whenyou saw us
overtheabbeywall...

187
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:26,315
and longed to beoneofus...

188
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,309
thatdidn't necessarilymean...

189
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:31,005
thatyouwere prepared for
thewaywe live here, did it?

190
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:35,594
No, Mother,
but I pray, and I try...

191
00:16:35,696 --> 00:16:37,312
and I am learning.
I reallyam.

192
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:39,593
What is the most important lesson
you have learned here, mychild?

193
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,896
Tofind outwhat
is thewill ofGod...

194
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:44,050
and todo it
wholeheartedly.

195
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:48,030
Maria...

196
00:16:48,142 --> 00:16:50,839
itseems to be
thewill ofGod...

197
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:52,105
thatyou leave us.

198
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:54,078
- Leaveyou?
- Onlyforawhile, Maria.

199
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:56,912
Oh, no, please, don'tdothat.
Don'tsend meaway.

200
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,668
This iswhere I belong.
It's myhome, myfamily.

201
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:01,402
It's mylife.

202
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:03,286
Butareyou truly
readyforit?

203
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,074
Yes, I am.

204
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,149
Perhaps ifyou go
out intotheworld...

205
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:08,251

206

208
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,219
ifyou could expect it
ofyourself.

209
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,893
I knowwhatyou expect,
Mother, and I can do it.

210
00:17:16,003 --> 00:17:17,721
- I promise I can.
- Maria.

211
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:22,461
Yes, Mother...

212

Unless thejokes improve, Max,
I'm taking backmyinvitation.

You didn't invite me

1009
01:03:19,233 --> 01:03:20,348
I invited myself.

1010
01:03:20,467 --> 01:03:21,400
Naturally.

1011
01:03:21,502 --> 01:03:23,027
You needed a chaperone...

1012
01:03:23,137 --> 01:03:24,571
and I needed a placetostay...

1013

Ah,you mean me.
I'm exciting?

Is thatso impossible?

1043
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:59,386
No,just, uh,
highlyimprobable.

1044
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,719
Thereyou go, running
yourselfdown again.

Well, I'm a dangerous driver.

You know,you're
much less ofa riddle...

1048
01:05:09,877 --> 01:05:11,493
when I seeyou here, Georg.

1049
01:05:11,612 --> 01:05:12,841
In mynatural habitat?

1050
01:05:12,946 --> 01:05:14,562
Yes, exactly.

1051
01:05:14,681 --> 01:05:17,082
Areyou trying tosay
that I'm moreat home here...

1052
01:05:17,184 --> 01:05:19,983
among the birds and theflowers...

1053

through thetrees...

1054
01:05:22,189 --> 01:05:23,668
likea restless sea, hmm?

1055
01:05:23,791 --> 01:05:25,407
How poetic.

1056
01:05:25,526 --> 01:05:28,450
Yes, itwas, rather,
wasn't it?

1057

Moreat home here
than inVienna...

1058
01:05:31,331 --> 01:05:33,800
in allyourglittering salons...

1059
01:05:33,901 --> 01:05:36,427
gossiping gaily
with bores I detest...

1060
01:05:36,537 --> 01:05:38,426
soaking myselfin champagne...

1061

waltzes byStrauss...

I can'teven remember.

1063
01:05:42,409 --> 01:05:44,093
Is thatwhatyou're
trying tosay?

1064
01:05:44,211 --> 01:05:45,406
Moreorless,yes.

1065
01:05:45,512 --> 01:05:47,731
Now,whatever
gaveyou that idea?

1066
01:05:50,551 --> 01:05:52,349
Oh, I do like it here, Georg.

1067
01:05:52,453 --> 01:05:54,649
It's so lovelyand peaceful.

1068
01:05:54,755 --> 01:05:56,951
Howcanyou leave it
as often asyou do?

1069
01:05:57,057 --> 01:06:00,027
Oh, pretending to be
madlyactive, I suppose.

1070
01:06:00,127 --> 01:06:03,495
Activitysuggests a life
filledwith purpose.

1071
01:06:03,597 --> 01:06:06,521
Could it be running
awayfrom memories?

1072
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:09,432
Mm-hmm.

1073

Hmm... lovely.

Oh, how unromantic.

1084
01:06:40,668 --> 01:06:41,954
Well, I would be
an ungrateful wretch...

How manyhave I had?

1097
01:07:17,137 --> 01:07:18,093
Two.

1098
01:07:18,205 --> 01:07:20,094
Make itan uneven three.

1099
01:07:23,243 --> 01:07:25,223
Still eating, Max, hmm?

1100
01:07:25,345 --> 01:07:26,460
Must be unhappy.

1101
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:27,968
That marvelous mixed quartet...

1102
01:07:28,082 --> 01:07:29,561
I've been trying for
months tosteal away...

1103

from Saul Hurok--

1104
01:07:30,784 --> 01:07:32,013
What happened, darling?

1105
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:33,678
Yesterday, Sasha Petrie
stolethem first.

1106
01:07:33,787 --> 01:07:35,073
Ifthere's onething
I hate, it's a thief.

1107
01:07:35,189 --> 01:07:38,489
Max,you reallymusttry
and learn to loveyourself.

1108
01:07:38,592 --> 01:07:41,243
Forthis, I had tocall
Paris, Rome, and Stockholm.

1109
01:07:41,361 --> 01:07:42,795
On Georg's telephone,
ofcourse?

1110
01:07:42,896 --> 01:07:45,331
Well, howelsecould I afford it?

1111
01:07:45,432 --> 01:07:47,753
Oh, dear, I like rich people.

1112
01:07:47,868 --> 01:07:49,302
I likethewaytheylive.

1113

I liketheway I live
when I'm with them.

1114
01:07:51,238 --> 01:07:53,036
I wonder
wherethechildren are.

1115
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:54,790
Obviouslytheymust have
heard I was coming...

1116
01:07:54,908 --> 01:07:55,898
andwent into hiding.

1117
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:58,741
I was hoping they'd

1118
01:07:58,846 --> 01:08:01,065

Well,what?

1122
01:08:15,596 --> 01:08:17,462
Haveyou made up
Georg's mindyet?

1123
01:08:17,564 --> 01:08:19,123
Do I hearwedding bells?

1124
01:08:19,233 --> 01:08:20,997
Pealing madly.

1125
01:08:21,101 --> 01:08:22,785
But not necessarilyforme.

1126
01:08:22,903 --> 01:08:24,337
What kind oftalk's that?

1127
01:08:24,438 --> 01:08:26,327
That is none-of-your-business talk, Max.

1128
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,601
I'm terriblyfond ofGeorg...

1129
01:08:27,708 --> 01:08:29,802
and I will not haveyou
toyingwith us.

1130
01:08:29,910 --> 01:08:32,800
But I'm a child. I liketoys,

1133
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:41,903
Well, let'sjustsay

Ifl knowyou, darling,

Oh, he's no
ordinaryman.

1139
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:52,832
He's rich.

1140
01:08:52,933 --> 01:08:54,162
When hiswifedied...

1141
01:08:54,268 --> 01:08:55,622
she left him with
a terrible heartache.

1142
01:08:55,736 --> 01:08:56,965
Andwhenyourhusband died...

Sitdown, Maria.

1890
01:53:26,406 --> 01:53:28,602
I couldn'tstay.

1891
01:53:28,709 --> 01:53:31,895
I knewthat here I'd be
awayfrom it. I'd besafe.

1892
01:53:32,012 --> 01:53:36,040
Maria, ourabbeyis not
to be used as an escape.

1893
01:53:36,150 --> 01:53:38,073
What is ityou can'tface?

1894
01:53:41,088 --> 01:53:42,567
I can'tface him again.

1895
01:53:42,690 --> 01:53:44,169

1896
01:53:45,793 --> 01:53:48,353
Thankyou,

1897
01:53:57,471 --> 01:53:59,360
CaptainVonTrapp?

1898
01:54:03,644 --> 01:54:06,204
Areyou in lovewith him?

1899
01:54:06,313 --> 01:54:08,361
I don't know!

1900
01:54:08,482 --> 01:54:11,497
I don't know, I...
The baroness said I was.

1901

She... shesaid that
hewas in lovewith me...

1902
01:54:14,421 --> 01:54:17,755
but I didn'twant
to believe it.

1903
01:54:17,858 --> 01:54:20,441
Oh, thereweretimeswhen

Ifl did, I didn't know it.

I was there
on Cod's errand.

1909
01:54:28,536 --> 01:54:30,516

02:05:28,228 --> 02:05:29,992
Now, that is a real problem.

2111
02:05:30,097 --> 02:05:33,078
I thoughta triparound
theworldwould be lovely.

2112
02:05:33,200 --> 02:05:34,588
Then I said, "Oh, Elsa...

2113
02:05:34,702 --> 02:05:36,659
there must besomeplace
bettertogo."

2114
02:05:36,770 --> 02:05:38,033
Don'tworry, darling. I--

2115
02:05:38,138 --> 02:05:39,299
Elsa.

2116
02:05:39,406 --> 02:05:40,965
Yes, Georg?

2117
02:05:41,075 --> 02:05:43,294
It's no use...

2118
02:05:43,411 --> 02:05:46,813
youandl.

2119
02:05:46,914 --> 02:05:51,067
I've been dishonest
to both ofus...

2120
02:05:51,185 --> 02:05:53,711
and utterly
unfairtoyou.

2121
02:05:57,691 --> 02:06:00,581
When two people
talkofmarriage--

2122
02:06:00,694 --> 02:06:01,741
No, don't.

2123
02:06:01,863 --> 02:06:04,719
Don'tsayanotherword,
Georg, please.

2124
02:06:06,767 --> 02:06:09,020
You see, um...

2125
02:06:09,136 --> 02:06:12,538
thereareotherthings
I've been thinking of.

2126
02:06:12,639 --> 02:06:16,132
Fond as I am ofyou...

2127
02:06:16,243 --> 02:06:18,769
I reallydon'tthink
you'rethe right man forme.

2128
02:06:18,879 --> 02:06:21,041
You're, um...

2129
02:06:21,148 --> 02:06:22,582
you're much too independent.

2130
02:06:22,683 --> 02:06:27,553
And I--I need someone
who needs medesperately...

2131
02:06:27,655 --> 02:06:30,909
orat least needs
mymoneydesperately.

2132
02:06:33,227 --> 02:06:36,049
I'veenjoyed everymoment
we've had together.

2133
02:06:36,163 --> 02:06:38,177
I dothankyou forthat.

2134
02:06:39,566 --> 02:06:43,833
Now, if, um, ifyou'll forgive me...

2135
02:06:43,938 --> 02:06:46,157
I'll go inside, packmylittle bags...

2136
02:06:46,274 --> 02:06:48,800
and return toVienna,
where I belong.

2137
02:06:53,114 --> 02:06:56,516
And somewhereoutthere
is ayoung lady...

2138
02:06:56,617 --> 02:06:58,005
who I think...

2139
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:02,168
will neverbea nun.

2140
02:07:13,067 --> 02:07:15,684
Aufwiedersehen, darling.

2141
02:07:42,163 --> 02:07:43,722

2142
02:07:48,603 --> 02:07:52,836

2143
02:07:56,110 --> 02:07:58,363

2144
02:07:58,479 --> 02:07:59,867
Hmm?

2145

No, no, no.

2146
02:08:03,117 --> 02:08:04,505

Uh, mayl?

2148
02:08:21,902 --> 02:08:26,021
You know, I was...
I was thinking...

2149
02:08:26,140 --> 02:08:29,542
and I waswondering
twothings.

2150
02:08:29,644 --> 02:08:34,548
Whydidyou
run awaytotheabbey?

2151
02:08:34,648 --> 02:08:36,036
And...

2152
02:08:36,150 --> 02:08:39,734
whatwas it
that madeyou come back?

2153
02:08:39,854 --> 02:08:41,572
Well, I...

2154
02:08:41,688 --> 02:08:43,554
had an obligation tofulfill...

2155
02:08:43,658 --> 02:08:45,376
and I...

2156
02:08:45,492 --> 02:08:47,324
I came back
tofulfill it.

2157
02:08:47,428 --> 02:08:49,476
Is thatall?

2158
02:08:51,098 --> 02:08:53,055
And I missed
thechildren.

2159
02:08:53,167 --> 02:08:54,487
Yes.

2160
02:08:55,936 --> 02:08:57,290
Onlythechildren?

2161
02:08:57,405 --> 02:08:58,520
No.Yes!

2162
02:08:58,639 --> 02:09:00,926
Isn't it right I should
have missed them?

2163
02:09:01,041 --> 02:09:02,998
Oh,yes!
Yes, ofcourse!

2164
02:09:03,110 --> 02:09:06,000

02:09:06,113 --> 02:09:09,242

2167
02:09:13,120 --> 02:09:14,508

2170
02:09:23,364 --> 02:09:26,015
And Ijustthought

2183
02:10:04,104 --> 02:10:08,337

Canyou?

2186
02:10:52,620 --> 02:10:54,600
The Reverend Mother

2187
02:10:54,722 --> 02:10:56,611
"when the Lord

02:11:53,480 --> 02:12:00,785
Perhaps I had a miserableyouth

2200

2361
02:23:35,616 --> 02:23:36,936
telling each other
to bequiet.

2362
02:23:37,051 --> 02:23:39,031
Mostly,we missed

02:24:04,678 --> 02:24:06,658
I would havetoldyou,
butyouwereaway.

2374
02:24:06,780 --> 02:24:07,804
I had to make
a last-minutedecision.

2375
02:24:07,915 --> 02:24:10,646
I was fortunate
toenterthem atall.

2378
02:24:13,854 --> 02:24:16,619
Imagine, seven children
in onefamily.

2379
02:24:16,723 --> 02:24:19,488
Max! Somehow I recall...

2380

2385
02:24:30,504 --> 02:24:32,632
Oh, darling, don'tyou think--
justthis once?

2386
02:24:32,740 --> 02:24:34,959
Absolutely
outofthequestion.

2387
02:24:35,075 --> 02:24:37,442
Georg, this is forAustria.

2388
02:24:37,544 --> 02:24:40,275
ForAustria?
There is noAustria!

2389
02:24:40,381 --> 02:24:41,906
ButtheAnschluss

2390
02:24:42,016 --> 02:24:44,064
Let's at least
begrateful forthat.

Grateful!

2392
02:24:47,821 --> 02:24:50,142
You know, Max...

2393
02:24:50,257 --> 02:24:54,114
sometimes I don't
believe I knowyou.

2394
02:24:56,263 --> 02:24:58,220
Father, I forgot.

2395
02:24:58,332 --> 02:25:00,255

You mustconvince him.

2400
02:25:17,017 --> 02:25:19,873
Max, I can'taskhim
to be less than he is.

2401

Then I'll talkto him.

02:25:25,593 --> 02:25:29,985
Oh, I know. Itwouldn't

2405
02:25:34,635 --> 02:25:36,103

02:27:22,576 --> 02:27:26,570

Liesl

2451
02:28:20,734 --> 02:28:22,623
What is it?

2452
02:28:22,736 --> 02:28:24,124
Berlin.

2453
02:28:24,238 --> 02:28:28,141
They'veoffered me
a commission in theirnavy.

2454
02:28:28,242 --> 02:28:30,529
I've been requested
toaccept immediately...

2455
02:28:30,644 --> 02:28:34,547
and reporttotheirnaval base
at Bremerhaven tomorrow.

2456
02:28:34,648 --> 02:28:36,867
I knewsomething
likethiswould happen...

2457
02:28:36,984 --> 02:28:39,601
but I didn'tthink
itwould besosoon.

2458
02:28:39,720 --> 02:28:43,145
To refusethem would be
fatal forall ofus...

2459
02:28:43,257 --> 02:28:47,410
andjoining them
would be... unthinkable.

2460
02:28:52,466 --> 02:28:55,083
Getthechildren

2461
02:28:55,202 --> 02:28:58,263

2466
02:29:53,761 --> 02:29:56,162
Itstrains myback,
it breaks myheart...

2467
02:29:56,263 --> 02:29:57,731
when I thinkof
a certain singing group...

I'm making it.

2474
02:30:09,776 --> 02:30:12,575
Whydoesn't Father

2475
02:30:12,680 --> 02:30:15,263

2485
02:30:34,735 --> 02:30:35,634
Shh!

2487
02:31:04,231 --> 02:31:05,699
Yes, as a matter
offact...

2488
02:31:05,799 --> 02:31:07,688
wecouldn't
get itstarted.

2489
02:31:10,237 --> 02:31:11,625
Kobb.

2490
02:31:13,741 --> 02:31:16,142

2492
02:31:26,253 --> 02:31:28,142
Car EngineStarts

2493
02:31:40,100 --> 02:31:41,534
Excellent, Kobb.

2494
02:31:45,272 --> 02:31:46,706
I've notaskedyou...

2495
02:31:46,807 --> 02:31:49,868
whereyou andyour
familyaregoing.

2496
02:31:49,977 --> 02:31:51,502
Norhaveyou asked me
whyl'm here.

2497
02:31:51,612 --> 02:31:53,000
Well, apparently,
we're both suffering...

2498
02:31:53,113 --> 02:31:55,207
from a deplorable
lackofcuriosity.

2499
02:31:55,315 --> 02:31:59,616
Youweresenta telegram,
whichyou did notanswer...

2500
02:31:59,720 --> 02:32:02,781
from the navy
oftheThird Reich.

2501
02:32:02,890 --> 02:32:06,110
I was underthe impression,
HerrZeller...

2502
02:32:06,227 --> 02:32:10,619
thatthecontents oftelegrams
inAustria are private!

2503
02:32:10,731 --> 02:32:13,655
At leasttheAustria I know.

2504
02:32:13,767 --> 02:32:15,565
I have myorders.

2505

whereyouwill acceptyourcommission.

2507
02:32:21,675 --> 02:32:23,564
I'm afraid that's...

2508
02:32:23,677 --> 02:32:28,069
going to be
quite impossible.

2509
02:32:28,181 --> 02:32:31,037
You see,we, uh...
all ofus--

2510

2514
02:32:39,994 --> 02:32:42,088
Couldn't possibly
letthem down now.

2515
02:32:42,196 --> 02:32:44,290
Ijust hope
we're nottoo late.

2516
02:32:44,398 --> 02:32:46,082

2520
02:32:52,840 --> 02:32:54,820
beyond anything
even I'vedreamtof.

2521
02:32:54,942 --> 02:32:57,070
Likeyou,
HerrZeller...
